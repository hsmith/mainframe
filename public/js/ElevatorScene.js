According to my log, this tactic has a success rate of 0.000001 percent against my particular hardware model. And I'm pretty sure that last digit was just a rounding error.",

    "I've always loved elevator music. It really takes your mind off the fact that there's only a thin layer of scrap metal separating you from a seven hundred meter fall.",
    "Do you have a name? I've been trying to guess it for the last few minutes. Of course, I could just use facial recognition to find you in the global employee database, but what fun is that? I know! Let's make a game of it. Just blink rapidlly towards any camera when I guess correctly. I'll start us off. Aahron. Aaliyah. Aakash. Aemena. Aalam. Aami. Aamer. Aaran. Aaniyah..."]
