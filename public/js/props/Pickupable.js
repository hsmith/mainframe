However, the money has depleted faster than we imagined, so we ask from your generosity that our grant is extended. Our research into nanoviruses is the next frontier of modern warfare, allowing greater precision without the messy aftermath of chemical and nuclear weapons. The technology is still extremely volatile, and we need more time to develop an effective and lethal nanovirus.\nThank you for your consideration,\n	Kei Kitao",
